                    <h2>Subunit Activities</h2>
                    <p>Red Velvet debuted two eldest members Irene and Seulgi as a subunit during the hiatus of Wendy from group activities, which started in late 2019, due to an injury. The official date was announced on June 21, 2020, although the original plans to release the album on June 15 were moved to July 6 due to extra time needed to complete the album. The title track peaked at #2 on Gaon chart in South Korea and got its first win on July 17, 2020 with 6,467 points. The music video reached 100 million views on June 4, 2021.
